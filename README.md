my first project from the odin project course.

in this project ill be using what ive learned so far to create a recipes webpage im guessing ill be using alot of oredered and unoredered lists as well as image elements etc.. pretty much everything ive been learning so far to create this recipes project and using git to save my progress aswell.
at the end of it all i wil be pushing the project to github where i can view it from the repository.

note to self do not make changes via github only make changes locally.

Tane.
